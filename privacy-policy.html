    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 12, 2026</p>

    <p>Cloud Motion Lab LLC ("we", "our", "us") built <strong>Spin Pro: Spin the Wheel Game</strong> ("the App") as a free ad-supported app with optional premium subscription. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Spin Pro does not require you to create an account. All wheel data (custom wheels, segments, settings) is stored locally on your device using on-device storage. We do not collect, transmit, or store your wheel data on any external server.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services that may collect information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — We display ads through Google AdMob. Google may collect device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to serve relevant ads. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> — If you purchase a subscription, the transaction is handled entirely by Apple. We do not have access to your payment information. See <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Custom wheel names and segments</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings (sound, haptics, spin duration)</li>
        <li>Onboarding completion status</li>
        <li>Subscription status</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The free version of Spin Pro displays banner and interstitial advertisements powered by Google AdMob. You can remove all ads by subscribing to Spin Pro Premium. AdMob may use device advertising identifiers and usage data to serve personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device's Settings under Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Apple Advertising.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>Spin Pro offers auto-renewable subscriptions to remove ads and unlock premium features. Payment is processed by Apple through your App Store account. We do not have access to your credit card or payment details.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Spin Pro does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App does not require any personal information to function. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All your wheel data stays on your device. We do not operate servers that store user data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data stored on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date.</p>
